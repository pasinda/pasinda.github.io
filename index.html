    <p>Nadungamuwa Raja is an Indian Tusker born 1953 in Mysore State, India.. Raja is the main casket 
        bearer of the procession of Esala held in Kandy, Sri Lanka.Nadungamuwe Raja is considered as the tallest tusker in Asia.11.5 feet</p>
    <h2>Specialty Pastries</h2>
    <p>Raja is not like other Tuskers in Sri Lanka.. He resisted confined spaces like traveling in the back of a lorry or in a train but was ever willing to walk a long distance.. Other Tuskers are traveling to Kandy by some truck and Raja is going to Kandy with his own foot 100Km from Nadungamuwa.. His journey to Kandy takes 3 days and after the procession of Esala he is coming back to Nadungamuwa as same way</p>
